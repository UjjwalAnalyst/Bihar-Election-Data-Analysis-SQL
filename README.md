# Bihar-Election-Data-Analysis-SQL
This project presents a complete SQL-based analysis of the Bihar Election dataset, focusing on voter turnout patterns, party-wise performance, constituency-level insights, and candidate comparisons. Using SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions, the analysis uncovers meaningful trends in voting behaviour and electoral outcomes. The goal of this project is to transform raw election data into clear, data-driven insights that help understand which parties performed strongly, which constituencies showed high or low participation, and how vote margins varied across regions. This repository includes the dataset, structured SQL queries, and summarized results to help others explore and learn from the election data.
